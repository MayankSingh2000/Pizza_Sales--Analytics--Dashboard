# Pizza_Sales--Analytics--Dashboard
This project involves analyzing pizza sales data using Microsoft Power BI. The data was imported from an MS SQL Server database and then transformed, modeled, and visualized in Power BI Desktop.

The goal of this dashboard was to analyze and derive insights on the sales performance of different pizza based on their categories and sizes. It also allowed me to uncover daily and monthly trends in terms of total orders, percentage of sales contributed by pizza size and category, total revenue and total orders, best-selling and worst selling pizza based on different metrics.
